# Faiss-Imputer Example Notebooks

Welcome to the `notebooks` directory of the `faiss-imputer` repository! Here, you'll find a collection of example notebooks that demonstrate the capabilities of the `faiss-imputer` library for missing data imputation using the Faiss algorithm.

## Introduction

The `faiss-imputer` library provides an innovative solution to handling missing values in datasets. Leveraging the power of Faiss, a high-performance similarity search and clustering library, `faiss-imputer` performs efficient k-nearest neighbors imputation.

## Example Notebooks

Explore the following example notebooks to learn how to utilize the `faiss-imputer` library:

1. [Imputing Missing Values with Faiss Imputer](Impute_Missing_Values_with_Faiss_Imputer.ipynb): Walk through a step-by-step example of imputing missing values in a synthetic dataset using the `faiss-imputer` library.


## Get Started

To get started, simply navigate to the desired notebook and open it in your preferred Jupyter environment. Follow along with the code examples and explanations to understand how `faiss-imputer` can enhance your data preprocessing workflows.
